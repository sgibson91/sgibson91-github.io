          The Turing Way is a handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative
          data science. The Turing Way project is open source, open collaboration,
          and community-driven. We involve and support a diverse community of
          contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and
          effective for everyone. Our goal is to provide all the information that
          researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public
          sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to
          reproduce and reuse.
