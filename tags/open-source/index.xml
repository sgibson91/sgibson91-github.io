      <description>Binder is a project that allows users to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by BinderHub, which is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud.
One such Binder service is mybinder.org and is free to use. More information about mybinder.org and the team that runs is can be found on the &amp;ldquo;About mybinder.org&amp;rdquo; page.
As a member of the Binder operating team, Sarah&amp;rsquo;s role involves maintaining the mybinder.</description>

      <title>The Turing Way</title>

      <description>The Turing Way is an online handbook - and global community - dedicated to fostering gold-standard reproducible research.
It&amp;rsquo;s a cultural movement with the potential to transform data science.
 There is a crisis of reproducibility in science. &amp;lsquo;Publish-or-perish&amp;rsquo; incentives and excessive data secrecy stifles progress and wastes resources: siloed science is slow science.
The Turing Way is an evolving online &amp;lsquo;handbook&amp;rsquo; on how to conduct world-leading, reproducible research in academic data science and AI with the goal of making reproducible science &amp;ldquo;too easy not to do&amp;rdquo;.</description>
