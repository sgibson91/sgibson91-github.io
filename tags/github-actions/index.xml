I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment. It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&amp;rsquo;t have access to secrets. This resulted in my writing the test-this-pr action and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.</description></item></channel></rss>
