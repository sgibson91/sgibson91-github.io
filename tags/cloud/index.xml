      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hi everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah! I&amp;rsquo;m a Research Data Scientist at the Alan Turing Institute and I&amp;rsquo;m also an operator of mybinder.org. It&amp;rsquo;s really cool seeing how many people here are interested in BinderHub!&amp;quot;
And it is cool. Really cool! But also a bit scary as a room full of Research Software Engineers (each of them much further on in their careers than I am) suddenly turn to me, eager for the knowledge I was surely about to impart to them.</description>

      <description>Binder is a project that allows users to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by BinderHub, which is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud.
One such Binder service is mybinder.org and is free to use. More information about mybinder.org and the team that runs is can be found on the &amp;ldquo;About mybinder.org&amp;rdquo; page.
As a member of the Binder operating team, Sarah&amp;rsquo;s role involves maintaining the mybinder.</description>
