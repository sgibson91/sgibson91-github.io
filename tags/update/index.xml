It feels like such a long time since I wrote a blog post but the truth is that I&rsquo;ve just been up to so many exciting things!
So this blog post will be a quick run down on everything I&rsquo;ve been up to recently.</p><p>At the start of January, I helped organise and run the<a href="https://research-software-reactor.github.io/">Research Software Reactor</a> with<a href="https://twitter.com/ixek">Tania Allard</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/gerardjgorman">Gerard Gorman</a>.
Our topic was &ldquo;<a href="https://research-software-reactor.github.io/blog/devops4rse">DevOps for better software and research reproducibility</a>&rdquo;.
We had around 30 attendees come together at the Turing Institute for 2 days and learn about<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> for automating their workflows.
The aim was to produce reproducible software to support gold-standard research.</p></description></item><item><title>Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship 2020</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</guid><description><p>So 2020 is off to an incredibly exciting start!</p><p><strong>I have been awarded a Software Sustainability Institute 2020 Fellowship!!!</strong> &#x1f389; &#x1f389; &#x1f389;</p><p>The<a href="https://software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a> (SSI) is an organisation that facilitates the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”).
Its mission is to become the world-leading hub for research software practice.
The Institute is based at the Universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton, and draws on a team of experts with a breadth of experience in software development, project and programme management, research facilitation, publicity and community engagement.</p></description></item><item><title>2019: Seasons of Reflection</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/seasons-of-reflection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/seasons-of-reflection/</guid><description><p>As 2019 comes to a close, I have spent a full year as a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at The Alan Turing Institute.
A lot has changed over the last 12 months and I&rsquo;ve come a long way - sometimes surprising myself!</p><h2 id="winter-snowflake">Winter &#x2744;&#xfe0f;</h2><p>In February, I gave my first professional talk at the<a href="https://cloud.ac.uk/workshops/feb2019/">UKRI Cloud Working Group workshop</a> hosted by The Francis Crick Institute.
It wasn&rsquo;t the furthest I&rsquo;ve travelled for a conference giving it&rsquo;s next door to the British Library, but it was certainly good practice!</p></description></item></channel></rss>
