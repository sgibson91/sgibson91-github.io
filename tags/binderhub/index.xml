I&amp;rsquo;m a Research Data Scientist at the Alan Turing Institute and I&amp;rsquo;m also an operator of mybinder.org. It&amp;rsquo;s really cool seeing how many people here are interested in BinderHub!&amp;quot;
And it is cool. Really cool! But also a bit scary as a room full of Research Software Engineers (each of them much further on in their careers than I am) suddenly turn to me, eager for the knowledge I was surely about to impart to them.</description></item><item><title>HelmUpgradeBot</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/project/helmupgradebot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/project/helmupgradebot/</guid><description>While managing BinderHubs, I found that there were a lot of things I had to deal with manually and, inevitably, I failed to keep on top of them. Most notably, the two biggest problems I faced were i) keeping my BinderHub up-to-date with the latest software released by the Binder team, and ii) keeping the size of the image registry manageable and within budget.
Hence I developed HelmUpgradeBot!
Keeping software up-to-date The first problem I wanted to solve was the manual updates I had to perform to keep my BinderHub up-to-date with the software the Binder team releases, packaged as a Helm Chart.</description></item></channel></rss>
