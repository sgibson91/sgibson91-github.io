See an example here. A pattern I often use to update my working branch with the default branch is: git checkout main git pull # Add `upstream main` if appropriate git checkout my_branch git merge main Mostly this is fine, but occasionally merge conflicts happen. If I know I want to keep a specific version of a conflicting file from one of the branches (as opposed to finding a non-conflicting combination), --theirs/--ours can be used.</description></item><item><title>How I automated authorised cloud deployments from Pull Requests with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</guid><description>This blog was originally posted on the Jupyter blog: https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32
I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment. It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&amp;rsquo;t have access to secrets. This resulted in my writing the test-this-pr action and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.</description></item><item><title>Create a Blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:28:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</guid><description>As a scientist in today&amp;rsquo;s ever connected, digital world, having a platform to talk about one&amp;rsquo;s work can be a really useful tool. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to strike up new collaborations or promote your freshly published paper, a blog can help signal boost your work and function as an archive of your ideas (the developed and forgotten).
I put together a tutorial for building a blog site from scratch using Hugo and GitHub Pages - the same tools I use to host this site!</description></item><item><title>Collaborations Workshop 2021</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/collabw21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:13:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/collabw21/</guid><description>At the end of March 2021, I attended the Collaborations Workshop hosted by the Software Sustainability Institute. The following is my round-up of what the event is, who runs it, and some of my highlights.
What is the SSI? The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI for short) is a network of UK universities, Research Software Engineering groups and policy makers dedicated in improving the quality, sustainability and recognition of research software. They help the members in their network learn software skills and best practices, and advocate for culture change in their organisations and institutions.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Integration: Fail Fast and Fail First</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/continuous-integration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/continuous-integration/</guid><description>Sarah and Graham have different career backgrounds - Sarah having come through academia whereas Graham earned his stripes in industry. However in their current roles, they often find themselves using the same tools, for example Continuous Integration. They have written this blog post to identify how academia and industry may use Continuous Integration in different ways, and what they might learn from one another.
What is Continuous Integration and why do we use it?</description></item><item><title>February 2020 Update</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/february-2020-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/february-2020-update/</guid><description>Hello friends! üëã It feels like such a long time since I wrote a blog post but the truth is that I&amp;rsquo;ve just been up to so many exciting things! So this blog post will be a quick run down on everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently.
At the start of January, I helped organise and run the Research Software Reactor with Tania Allard and Gerard Gorman. Our topic was &amp;ldquo;DevOps for better software and research reproducibility&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship 2020</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</guid><description>So 2020 is off to an incredibly exciting start!

A lot has changed over the last 12 months and I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way - sometimes surprising myself!
Winter ‚ùÑÔ∏è In February, I gave my first professional talk at the UKRI Cloud Working Group workshop hosted by The Francis Crick Institute. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the furthest I&amp;rsquo;ve travelled for a conference giving it&amp;rsquo;s next door to the British Library, but it was certainly good practice!</description></item><item><title>Diving Into Leadership to Build Push-Button Code</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/diving-into-leadership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/diving-into-leadership/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Hi everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah! I&amp;rsquo;m a Research Data Scientist at the Alan Turing Institute and I&amp;rsquo;m also an operator of mybinder.org. It&amp;rsquo;s really cool seeing how many people here are interested in BinderHub!&amp;quot;
And it is cool. Really cool! But also a bit scary as a room full of Research Software Engineers (each of them much further on in their careers than I am) suddenly turn to me, eager for the knowledge I was surely about to impart to them.</description></item><item><title>Media</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/media/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/media/</guid><description>A collection of external media posts that discuss projects that Sarah is involved in or that have interviewed Sarah directly (in reverse chronological order).

I am always happy to attend and speak at conferences, and I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with new audiences. I am grateful to all the conference organisers who have done a wonderful job hosting me so far.</description></item><item><title>Pricing</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/speaking/pricing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/speaking/pricing/</guid><description>I reserve the right to negotiate or waive these fees at my discretion.

I love sharing my ideas and connecting with a community through giving talks and workshops. And it&amp;rsquo;s a huge privilege that I am able to so and that communities are interested and excited to hear what I have to say.
This document represents expectations and boundaries around such speaking engagements so that I can continue to give talks that I love and provide a high quality experience for communities in a sustainable manner.</description></item></channel></rss>
