Most notably, the two biggest problems I faced were i) keeping my BinderHub up-to-date with the latest software released by the Binder team, and ii) keeping the size of the image registry manageable and within budget.
Hence I developed HelmUpgradeBot!
Keeping software up-to-date The first problem I wanted to solve was the manual updates I had to perform to keep my BinderHub up-to-date with the software the Binder team releases, packaged as a Helm Chart.</description></item><item><title>Binder</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/project/binder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/project/binder/</guid><description>Binder is a project that allows users to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by BinderHub, which is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud.
One such Binder service is mybinder.org and is free to use. More information about mybinder.org and the team that runs is can be found on the &amp;ldquo;About mybinder.org&amp;rdquo; page.
As a member of the Binder operating team, Sarah&amp;rsquo;s role involves maintaining the mybinder.</description></item><item><title>The Turing Way</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/project/turing-way/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/project/turing-way/</guid><description>The Turing Way is an online handbook - and global community - dedicated to fostering gold-standard reproducible research.
It&amp;rsquo;s a cultural movement with the potential to transform data science.
There is a crisis of reproducibility in science. &amp;lsquo;Publish-or-perish&amp;rsquo; incentives and excessive data secrecy stifles progress and wastes resources: siloed science is slow science.
The Turing Way is an evolving online &amp;lsquo;handbook&amp;rsquo; on how to conduct world-leading, reproducible research in academic data science and AI with the goal of making reproducible science &amp;ldquo;too easy not to do&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
