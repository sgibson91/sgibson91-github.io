Hello! :wave:

I hope you find this site a useful source of information about the work I do as a [Research Software Engineer](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/sarah-gibson) at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) - the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence - and as an open source contributor!
