As 2019 comes to a close, I have spent a full year as a Research Software Engineer at The Alan Turing Institute.
A lot has changed over the last 12 months and I've come a long way - sometimes surprising myself!

## Winter :snowflake:

In February, I gave my first professional talk at the [UKRI Cloud Working Group workshop](https://cloud.ac.uk/workshops/feb2019/) hosted by The Francis Crick Institute.
It wasn't the furthest I've travelled for a conference giving it's next door to the British Library, but it was certainly good practice!

I [gave a presentation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/conferences/presentations/UKRI_cloud_2019-02-12/UKRI_cloud_demo_2019-02-12.md) on why reproducibility is important in scientific research and how Binder can be used to capture the computational environment so analyses can be reliably re-run.
It involved [live demonstrations of Binder launches](https://github.com/binder-examples/matplotlib-versions), which was quite nerve-wracking!

## Spring :tulip:

As we moved into spring, the workshops ramped up!

[_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) ran **three** workshops in March alone!
Two for researchers who'd like to use Binder and one for RSEs who may want to run a BinderHub as a service for researchers.
Preparing for the BinderHub one was particularly challenging as deploying one wasn't something I'd been successful at yet!
Thankfully, breakthrough was made with enough time to write the workshop.

## Summer :sunny:

## Autumn :maple_leaf:

I'm very grateful for all the opportunities I've been given this year to learn, grow and share my new knowledge and experiences.
I can't wait to see what's coming next!

So I'm coming into 2020 like...
