Hello friends! :wave:
It feels like such a long time since I wrote a blog post but the truth is that I've just been up to so many exciting things!
So this blog post will be a quick run down on everything I've been up to recently.

At the start of January, I helped organise and run the [Research Software Reactor](https://research-software-reactor.github.io/) with [Tania Allard](https://twitter.com/ixek) and [Gerard Gorman](https://twitter.com/gerardjgorman).
Our topic was "[DevOps for better software and research reproduciblility](https://research-software-reactor.github.io/blog/devops4rse)".
We had around 30 attendees come together at the Turing Institute for 2 days and learn about [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automating their workflows.
The aim was to produce reproducible software to support gold-standard research.

Later on in January, I was invited to a [PyData Cambridge Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Cambridge-Meetup/) to talk about how [_The Turing Way_](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) and [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder) advocate for reprodicible research.
I also ran my [Zero-to-Binder tutorial](https://bit.ly/zero-to-binder-tutorial) with the attendees.
I received a lot of lovely feedback about how having an intereactive session as part of the talk was really fun!

I kicked off February by travelling up to Manchester to attend the [SSI](https://software.ac.uk/) Inaugural Fellows Meeting.
It was really wonderful to meet all the other [Fellows](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows) in person, hear about our goals and figure out how to work together to achieve them.
