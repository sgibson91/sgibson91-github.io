I also lead workshops and tutorials on Binder for all ranges of abilities both in-person and remotely.
I am always happy to attend and speak at conferences, and I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with new audiences.

I love sharing my ideas and connecting with a community through giving talks and workshops. And it&amp;rsquo;s a huge privilege that I am able to so and that communities are interested and excited to hear what I have to say.
This document represents expectations and boundaries around such speaking engagements so that I can continue to give talks that I love and provide a high quality experience for communities in a sustainable manner.</description></item></channel></rss>
